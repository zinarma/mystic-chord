        Mystic Chord Music is the music production company run by Dr. Ross
        Mitchell, a pianist, composer, and musicologist who seeks to unite all
        three sides of his career. The company is named after the famed "Mystic
        Chord" created by Russian composer Alexander Skryabin, who held similar
        goals of synthesis and cohesion: <br />
        "For us now begins a synthesis: harmony becomes melody and melody
        becomes harmony...and for me there is no distinction between melody and
        harmony - they are one and the same." - Alexander Skryabin.
